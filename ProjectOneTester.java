/* PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
 * 
 * PROBLEM: You are running a massive company but your internal emails and memos keep getting leaked.
 * How do we find out whos leaking these memos, while the memos look (nearly) identical for every recipient.
 * Well, in 2008, tesla had the same problem, and they used a form of Steganography (Hiding secret messages in a message) to solve it
 * They sent out different emails to everyone in the company which has a unique combo of single and double spaces so that it can be traced back to a single recipient.
 * So my project will recreate this, and allow you to trace individual unique doccuments back to the individual it was sent to
 * 
 * 
 * CLASS DESCRIPTIONS:
 * Document:
 *    - A basic representation of a text document.
 *    - Holds the document's content and provides getters and setters.
 *    - Overrides toString() for a formatted representation.
 *
 * Employee:
 *    - Represents an employee with a name and a random unique 5-digit ID.
 *    - Overrides equals() and toString() for  comparison and representation.
 *
 * UniqueDocument (extends Document):
 *    - Extends/Inherits from Document and adds functionality to embed an employee's ID into a memo.
 *    - Converts the employee's ID into a binary string and encodes each bit into the spaces between first 17 words.
 *
 * ManageDocuments:
 *    - Manages collections of employees and unique documents.
 *    - Has functionality to add employees or documents, retrieve documents by employee, and display all documents.
 *
 * 
 * NOTE: The script only changes the first 17 spaces of a memo, i could have it cycle through and embed it everywhere hence
 * if only a portion of the memo gets leaked we can decode it, however ide have to account for a bunch of error correction ect
 * Plus it would likely make the user catch on while reading if there was weird spacing everywhere, 
 * So only submit the portion of the document that you want to be encoded, this could be the most confidential section of the memo.
