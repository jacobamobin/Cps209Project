/* PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
 * 
 * PROBLEM: You are running a massive company but your internal emails and memos keep getting leaked.
 * How do we find out whos leaking these memos, while the memos look (nearly) identical for every recipient.
 * Well, in 2008, tesla had the same problem, and they used a form of Steganography (Hiding secret messages in a message) to solve it
 * They sent out different emails to everyone in the company which has a unique combo of single and double spaces so that it can be traced back to a single recipient.
 * So my project will recreate this, and allow you to trace individual unique doccuments back to the individual it was sent to
